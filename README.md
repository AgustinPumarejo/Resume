## Circuit Sandbox
This one has a readme of its own that specifies the requirements for running the project since the database isn't hosted anywhere. "Diagramas y Especificaciones" contains the documentation of the project, "CircuitSandboxMVP" contains a set of files meant to be opened with Unity, you can access the scripts from the game via the "Scripts" folder inside "Assets". "Frontend" and "Backend" should be self-explanatory.

Running the "juego" HTML file locally, found inside "Frontend", should allow you to play the game and use the page but the database will not be functional.
