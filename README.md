## Circuit Sandbox
This one has a readme of its own that specifies the requirements for running the project since the database isn't hosted anywhere. "Diagramas y Especificaciones" contains the documentation of the project, "CircuitSandboxMVP" contains a set of files meant to be opened with Unity, you can access the scripts from the game via the "Scripts" folder inside "Assets". "Frontend" and "Backend" should be self-explanatory.

Running the "juego" HTML file locally, found inside "Frontend", should allow you to play the game and use the page but the database will not be functional.

## Syntax Highlighter
This is a program that receives a css file and outputs an html file with its syntax highlighted. To test the file, on needs to install racket and preferable Dr. Racket as well and run this command “(directory-CSS-To-HTML 1)”. All css files that are on the same folder as the syntax highlighter will be converted. There is a sample file with its html file already created.
